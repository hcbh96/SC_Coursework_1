# Project Numerical Continuation Code
General numerical continuation code for tracking limit cycles
as system parameters change

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

python3 [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

SciPy  [Scipy](https://pypi.org/project/scipy/)

pytest [pytest](pip install pytest)

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Clone git directory

```
git clone https://github.com/hcbh96/SC_Coursework_1.git
```

Navigate to the directory

```
cd SC_Coursework_1/
```

Visualse Continuation Graphs

```
python3 visualise_continuation_graphs.py 
```

## Running the tests

Tests can be run using the terminal command

```
py.test
```
Unfortunately the tests are currently broken as the code is not producing the intended output
